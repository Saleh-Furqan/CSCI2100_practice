Description:
A valley element is an element that is strictly less than its neighbors(neighbor elements is adjacent to the current element).
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a valley element, and return its index. 
If the array contains multiple valleys, return the index to any of the valleys.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = +âˆž. In other words, 
an element is always considered to be strictly less than a neighbor that is outside the array.
Hint: You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
